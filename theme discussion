can you suggest a good layout and style guide for the website, things like side bars, headers and stuff like that? I dont know what its called

You’re thinking of “information architecture” + “layout system” (and a bit of a design system). Here’s a solid, writer-friendly layout that fits your parchment theme and the features you planned (chapters, wiki, AI panel).

Layout recommendation: “Editor-first, panels around it”

Think of it like Scrivener/Obsidian: the writing stays central, everything else is a panel.

Overall shell (desktop)

Top header (thin): global actions + project switch + search + theme toggle

Left sidebar (primary nav): Projects / Chapters / Wiki / Search

Center (main canvas): editor or wiki page

Right sidebar (assistant): Claude / AI tools / citations / quick actions

This works great because your app has “content” (writing/wiki) plus “helpers” (AI, links, metadata).

Recommended screen layouts
1) Project Home

Header: Project name, export button, settings
Left sidebar: Chapters list (with status + word count)
Main: “Continue writing” + recent chapters + notes
Right panel (optional): AI “Ask my novel” + recent citations

2) Chapter Editor (your core screen)

Left sidebar: chapter list + create chapter + reorder
Main: editor page (paper sheet)
Right panel: AI tools (rewrite/expand), “Ask” results with citations, wiki mentions

Suggested sub-panels in the right sidebar:

Tabs: Ask | Rewrite | Notes | Citations

Or accordion sections

3) Wiki

Left sidebar: wiki type filter + search + page list
Main: wiki entry (paper sheet)
Right panel: backlinks, mentions, AI “draft entry / summarise”

4) Search

Main: results grouped (Chapters / Wiki)
Right panel: preview snippet + “open in editor” + “ask AI about this result”

“Parchment” style guide that won’t get in the way of writing
Visual rules

Background (app): darker parchment base

Surface (content): lighter “page” sheet in the center

Borders: soft, warm borders (not grey)

Shadows: gentle “paper lift” shadows

Typography: serif for content, sans for UI chrome

Hierarchy rules (important)

Your main editor text should be the most visually calm.

UI elements should be quiet:

low contrast icons

subtle separators

muted backgrounds

Spacing rules

Use a consistent spacing scale (Tailwind):

padding: p-4 / p-6 / p-8

gaps: gap-2 / gap-4 / gap-6

Give the editor generous margins:

max width: max-w-3xl or max-w-4xl

Borders

Prefer 1px soft borders:

border border-border

Avoid heavy outlines.

Shadows

Use one main shadow for the page:

shadow-paper (from your config)

Rounded corners

For panels: rounded-xl

For the page sheet: rounded-md (slightly less rounded feels more “paper”)

Component layout patterns (what to use where)
Header (thin, always visible)

Include:

Project selector (dropdown)

Global search (input)

Theme toggle

Profile/menu

“Export” button (only when relevant)

Keep it 48–56px height.

Left sidebar (navigation / lists)

Width: 280–320px

Contains:

primary nav (Projects, Chapters, Wiki)

context list (chapters list or wiki list)

Add a collapse button (mobile + focus mode)

Main content (“paper sheet”)

A single central card:

max width for readability

large padding

serif font

subtle texture optional

Right sidebar (AI / metadata)

Width: 360–420px

Tabs or accordion sections:

Ask (Q&A + citations)

Rewrite tools

Backlinks / mentions

Notes

This sidebar is where your AI work lives.

Mobile / small screen rules

On mobile, sidebars become drawers:

left nav: hamburger menu

right AI panel: a “sparkles” button that opens a drawer

Main content stays the parchment page.

Concrete “layout spec” (copyable)

If you want a single sentence spec to follow:

Three-column layout: left sidebar for navigation and lists, center parchment page for content, right sidebar for AI and metadata; thin header with global actions; drawers on mobile.

What I’d build first (so it feels good fast)

Chapter editor layout

Wiki layout

AI right sidebar tabs

Search page

If you want, I can generate:

a single React layout component (AppShell) using shadcn/ui + Tailwind

plus ChapterEditor page skeleton that matches this exact layout and parchment theme.

Say: “Generate AppShell + ChapterEditor skeleton” and I’ll paste the code.
